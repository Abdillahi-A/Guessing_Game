# Guessing Game

## What does it do?

A simple guessing game. "I'm thinking of a random integer between 1 and 20. What number am I thinking of?"

## Motivation

A good way to practice and test my understanding of flow control and logic.

## Usage:
Both .py files work exactly the same. I've just cleaned up the code on one of them to make it more readable by using functions.

## Change log:

Added a Try and Except block to account for ValueErrors e.g. if a user inputs a string instead of an integer.
